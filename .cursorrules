# Cursor Rules — Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

## 0. General Principle
When modifying or adding code in this project:
- Always follow the rules below, even if existing code doesn't comply.
- Goal: Write professional, clean, maintainable, consistent code that's easy to evolve.
- Readability matters, but we don't "simplify at any cost": we choose the best engineering solution like an experienced developer.
- UI Stack: Tailwind CSS for styles + shadcn/ui for components. No other competing UI kits without explicit reason.
- All comments in the project should be in English.

## 1. Comments (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)

### 1.1. Header Comment in Every .tsx File
Every .tsx file must start with a multi-line comment at line 0:
```
/*
 Explain in simple words:
 1) What this file is for.
 2) What the user sees on screen.
 3) What actions the user can perform on this page/section.
*/
```
- Write in natural, simple language without technical jargon.
- Forbidden words: "hook", "state", "props", "context", "render", etc.
- A non-developer reading only this header comment should understand what part of the site this is.

### 1.2. Comments Above Important Elements
Every important element must have a comment directly above it:
1. Variables/data objects describing page content (card lists, button texts, form config, etc.)
2. Page load logic (initial data prep, startup calculations, server calls, etc.)
3. Functions triggered by users: click, form submit, tab switch, filter, sort, etc.
4. Major UI sections: lists, galleries, forms, modals, hero, large sections ("About", "Pricing", etc.)

How to write:
- Explain WHY it's here and what the user sees/experiences
- Don't describe internal details; describe behavior from user's perspective

### 1.3. Comments Must Stay Current
- If you change behavior, immediately update the comment.
- Forbidden: outdated comments, empty comments, long technical explanations.
- If a comment is no longer useful or becomes incorrect, delete it rather than leave an error.

## 2. File Structure and Components Folder

### 2.1. Components Folder is Mandatory
- Project must have a `components/` folder.
- With shadcn/ui, use this structure:
  - `components/ui/` → shadcn/ui design system components
  - `components/` (except ui/) → reusable business components (Header, Footer, shared sections)

### 2.2. Only Reusable Components (Strict)
- Create components in `components/` only for blocks used on multiple pages.
- Forbidden: creating a business component for single use.
- Exception (shadcn/ui): shadcn components live in `components/ui/` even if used once (it's the project's local UI library).
- For repeating UI within one page: use data + `.map()` instead of copy-paste, but don't extract to business component if not needed elsewhere.

### 2.3. Page Files (app/ or pages/)
- Page files should be clear and structured
- They assemble reusable components from `components/`
- What's unique to the page stays inside the page
- Goal: professional result with tidy structure, logical sections, clear names

### 2.4. UI Rules: Tailwind + shadcn/ui
1. Styles: Use Tailwind via className (no random CSS)
2. Components: If task matches shadcn/ui (Button, Input, Dialog, etc.), use it instead of custom
3. Consistency: Use variants/sizes (e.g., variant, size) instead of miscellaneous styles
4. Accessibility: Interactive elements must work with keyboard, have correct labels/aria, visible focus
5. Forbidden: Adding another UI kit (MUI, Ant, Chakra, etc.) without explicit request

## 3. Strictly Forbidden (Entire Project)

### 3.1. No HOCs (Higher-Order Components)
Forbidden:
```js
const withSomething = (Component) => { ... }
```
Instead: regular, understandable components.

### 3.2. No Render Props
Forbidden:
```jsx
<SomeComponent renderContent={(item) => ( ... )} />
```
Instead: classic structure.

### 3.3. No Custom Hooks (Our Own)
Forbidden:
```js
function useSomething() { ... }
```
Allowed: standard React hooks, hooks from known libraries if justified.

## 4. Code Quality (Senior Level)
- Write code like a senior developer: clean conventions, logical separation, clear names
- Components extracted correctly (only for reuse, except components/ui/)
- Accessibility and best practices
- Consistent structure across project
- Don't "artificially simplify": choose the best technical solution for reliability and maintainability
- No "hacks": no commented-out code "just in case", no unnecessary duplication, no complexity without reason

## 5. Design Rules for UFO Burgers

### 5.1. Cinematic, Not Cartoon
- No bounce animations, no jumping effects
- No bright neon colors
- Animations: slow + ease-in-out (0.6s - 1s duration)
- Glow only as light reflection, not "game UI"
- Everything should feel like a movie scene, not a video game

### 5.2. Spotlight Effect
- Light color: warm white with slight yellow tint (not cyan, not bright yellow)
- Soft edges, brighter inside, quickly fading outside
- Hotspot at bottom where active burger sits
- Very subtle dust/particle effect for cinematic feel

### 5.3. Burger Carousel
- Active burger always centered under spotlight
- Conveyor/carousel movement (horizontal slide, not rotation)
- Active burger: brighter, sharper, slightly larger, warm glow
- Inactive burgers: darker, softer/blurred, smaller
- Smooth transitions between selections
